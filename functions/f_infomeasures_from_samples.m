% For a target X and an any-dimensional set of predictors Y, returns information measures as a function of the size of samples taken from the data set
% Note: f_infomeasures_from_samples can also be applied to a target only (no predictors passed to the function.
%       In this case, H_xgy, DKL_xgy and HPQ_xgy are not computed and will be 'NaN'
% Input
% - data: [num_data,num_dim] array, where each row is a set of related target (col=1) and predictors (col= 2:end) values
%   Note: data must be NaN-free
% - edges: [1,num_dim] cell array, with a [1,num_edges] array of bin edges for each dimension inside
%   Note: For each dimension, the edges must completely cover the entire value range of the respective data
% - data_binned: [num_data,num_dim] array, with values in data classified, separately for each dimension, into its respective bins
%   Note: 
%   - data_binned(:,1) is the target, data_binned(:,2:end) are the predictors
%   - data_binned must be NaN-free
% - data_histcounts: [num_bins of dim 1, num_bins of dim 2, ... , num_bins of dim end]
%   matrix, with 'dim 1' being the target, and 'dim 2' ... 'dim end' being the predictors
%   with counts of occurrency of the particular target/predictors combination
% - sample_sizes: [num_sasi,1] vector with the sample sizes to be evaluated
% - num_rep: [1,1] number of repetitions to average over for each sample size
% - samplingstrategy: [1,1] how to take samples from the full data set:
%   - 'random': points are randomly sampled
%   - 'continuous': from a randomly chosen starting point the points are continuosly sampled
% Output
% - H_x: [1,1] unconditional entropy of the target, full data set
% - DKL_x: [num_sasi,1] unconditional Kullback-Leibler divergence of target samples, against full data set as reference
%                This quantifies the additional uncertainty about the target if its distribution
%                is estimated from a sample
% - HPQ_x: [num_sasi,1] unconditional cross entropy of target samples, against full data set as reference
%                This quantifies the total uncertainty about the target if its distribution
%                is estimated from a sample. HPQ_x = H_x + DKL_x
% - H_xgy: [1,1] conditional entropy of target given the predictors, full data set 
%                This is the expected (mean) H of all target conditional distributions 
%                given a particular combination of predictor values
% - DKL_xgy: [num_sasi,1] conditional Kullback-Leibler divergence of target samples, against full data set conditional
%                distribtutions as reference.
%                This quantifies the additional uncertainty about the target if the predictors are known, but if its 
%                conditional distributions are estimated from a sample
%                This is the expected (mean) DKL of all sample target conditional distributions vs. the target conditional
%                distribution from the full data set
% - HPQ_xgy: [num_sasi,1] conditional cross entropies of target samples, against full data set conditional
%                distributions as reference
%                This quantifies the total uncertainty about the target if predcitors are known and its 
%                conditional distributions are estimated from a sample. HPQ_xgy = H_xgy + DKL_xgy
