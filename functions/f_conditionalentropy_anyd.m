function [Hcond, target_hist_p_combis] = f_conditionalentropy_anyd(data_histcounts, p_combis)
% Computes the conditional entropy of a target variable given any number of predictors >= 1
% i.e. there must be at least one predictor
% Input
% - data_histcounts: [num_bins of dim 1, num_bins of dim 2, ... , num_bins of dim end]
%   matrix, with 'dim 1' being the target, and 'dim 2' ... 'dim end' being the predictors
%   with counts of occurrency of the particular target/predictors combination
% - p_combis: [num_p_combis, num_dim -1] array with all possible bin number combinations (rows) of all predictors (columns) in data_histcounts
%   Note this excludes the first dimension in data_histcounts, as this is the target
% Note: Both data_histcounts and p_combis must be NaN-free
% Output
% - Hcond: [1,1] with conditional entropy in [bit]
% - target_hist_p_combis: [num_p_combis,num_target_bins] target histogram for each particular predictor combination
%   Note the order along the first dimension is the same as in p_combis
