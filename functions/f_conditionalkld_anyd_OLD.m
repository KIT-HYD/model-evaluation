function [ KLD ] = f_conditionalkld_anyd_OLD( histograms, histograms_hat)
% Returns the expected KLD over a set of histogram pairs (reference and estimate)
% The set is typically the set of all conditional target histograms for all
% possible combinations of predictors
% Input
% - histograms: [num_p_combis,num_bins] array of reference histograms (one per row)
% - histograms_hat: [num_p_combis,num_bins] array of estimated histograms (one per row)
%   Note: 
%   - Input has to be NaN-free
% Output
% - KLD: [1,1] expected KLD over all histogram pairs
