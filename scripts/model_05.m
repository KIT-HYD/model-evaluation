% A more advanced Rainfall-Runoff model: Reads the observed rainfall as input,
% and transforms it to output with a rainfall-intensity threshold and two
% linear reservoir approximations
% p_ebni is rainfall observed at Ebnit [mm/h]. This is the input.
% based on model_02, but rainfall-intensity threshold and second reservoir added
% Paramter values were found by minimizing NSE in the calibration period
% dt = 1 h
% precision (input, output, state variables): double
