% A simple Rainfall-Runoff model: Reads the observed rainfall as input,
% and transforms it to output with a linear reservoir approximation
% p_ebni is rainfall observed at Ebnit [mm/h]. This is the input.
% The value of the retention constant was found by minimizing NSE in the calibration period
% dt = 1 h
% precision (input, output, state variables): double
